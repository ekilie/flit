Features — Non-audio priorities for the Listen mobile app

Summary
- Focus: non-audio product improvements that deliver visible UX value (social, discovery, settings, reliability, accessibility).
- Goal: pick quick wins first, then medium work, then larger platform features.

Quick Wins (1–2 days)
- Theme toggle: light / dark / system preference persisted in settings (wire `ThemeProvider` to `useSettingsStore`).
- Save / Bookmark button on posts: local optimistic UI + backend sync.
- Share sheet on posts & profiles: use React Native `Share` API and deep links.
- Consistent Empty & Error states: ensure `EmptyState` and `ErrorState` used across feeds and profile screens.
- Skeleton loaders for lists: ensure skeletons show on slow loads (use `FeatureSkeletons` / `skeletons/*`).
- Haptics & small feedback: add haptics to post actions and important taps (already used in settings).

Medium Work (several days)
- Search screen: user/post/tag search with filters and recent searches.
- Bookmarks / Saved page: UI + API endpoints to list saved items and sync.
- Onboarding: progressive permission prompts (notifications, location) with explainers.
- Rich profile edit: avatar crop/resize flow, social links, bio validation.
- Share & deep link handling: support opening posts/profiles via URL schemes.

Larger Work (weeks)
- Offline-first caching & background sync for feed, bookmarks, and saved state.
- Threaded comments with moderation tools (report/delete, inline moderation UI).
- Push notifications backend improvements + client permission flows and quiet-hours logic.
- Full-text search backend + client with ranking and suggestions.

Accessibility & Quality
- Dynamic font-size support: ensure `fontSize` setting applies app-wide.
- High-contrast mode: implement theme variants and test color contrast.
- A11y: add proper accessibility labels, roles, and focus order on interactive elements.
- Tests: unit tests for core hooks (`useAuthStatus`, `usePostInteractions`) and `PostItem` snapshot tests.
- Analytics: event tracking for onboarding, sign-up, follow, share, bookmark.
